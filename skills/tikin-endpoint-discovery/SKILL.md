name: tikin-endpoint-discovery
description: Find the right tikin endpoint among 1,000+ across 16+ platforms. Use when you know the goal (e.g. "get a user's posts on Douyin") but not the exact API path, or when a platform has no dedicated skill (LinkedIn, Reddit, Bilibili, Weibo, WeChat, Kuaishou, Zhihu, Lemon8, etc.). Searches a bundled index and maps results to REST calls.

# tikin — Endpoint Discovery

tikin has 1,000+ endpoints. This skill finds the one you need, then hands off to `tikin-rest-api`.

## Setup gate

```bash
# The bundled index is searchable offline — no key needed to FIND an endpoint.
# But CALLING any endpoint you find requires a key:
[ -z "${TIKIN_API_KEY:-}" ] && echo "Index search works without a key; to actually call an endpoint, set TIKIN_API_KEY (see tikin-onboarding)."
```

## Use the bundled search CLI

`scripts/tikin-find-endpoint` — bundled **inside this skill's directory** — searches a trimmed
index of every endpoint (method, path, tag, summary, params). Run it by path relative to this
skill's directory (it works from any cwd; no PATH setup needed):

```bash
# goal-based search, scoped to a platform
<this-skill-dir>/scripts/tikin-find-endpoint "one video" --platform tiktok
<this-skill-dir>/scripts/tikin-find-endpoint "user posts" --platform douyin
<this-skill-dir>/scripts/tikin-find-endpoint "comments" --platform youtube --method GET

# no platform filter — search everything
<this-skill-dir>/scripts/tikin-find-endpoint "trending hashtag"
```

(`<this-skill-dir>` = the directory containing this SKILL.md. Other skills refer to this tool
as `tikin-find-endpoint` for short — it always means this script.)

Output lines look like:
```
GET  /api/v1/tiktok/app/v3/fetch_one_video  [TikTok-App-V3-API]  params: aweme_id
```

The index lives at `references/endpoint-index.json` (beside the script, inside this skill),
ships with the skill, and is refreshed on new releases when the API surface changes.

## Map a result to a call

Given `GET /api/v1/{platform}/{api}/{action}`, call it via REST (see `tikin-rest-api`):

```bash
BASE="${TIKIN_BASE_URL:-https://console.tikin.net}"
curl -s "$BASE/api/v1/tiktok/app/v3/fetch_one_video?aweme_id=..." \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TIKIN_API_KEY"
```

## Platforms without a dedicated skill

For LinkedIn, Reddit, Bilibili, Weibo, WeChat, Kuaishou, Zhihu, Lemon8, Toutiao, Xigua,
and more, discovery + REST is the path — there are no dedicated platform skills.

## Red flags

- Guessing endpoint paths instead of searching the index (paths and param names are specific).
- Forgetting param names — the CLI prints them; pass them exactly.
